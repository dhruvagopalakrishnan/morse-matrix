# morse-matrix
A hackathon project that builds a wireless optical data link using an Arduino LED transmitter and a Python + OpenCV webcam receiver. The Arduino converts text into Morse code blinks, and the Python app detects LED brightness in real time, decodes DOTs/DASHes, and reconstructs the original message.

Features include:
Arduino Morse transmitter (A–Z, 0–9)
Real-time Python decoder with OpenCV
Adaptive brightness auto-calibration for varying lighting
Timing-based Morse detection with a clean, modular workflow
This repo contains the Arduino code, Python receiver, and supporting files from our completed hackathon build.
